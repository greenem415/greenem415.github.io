            <p>You've never killed anyone before, but there's no way this psychopath will go peacefully. It's kill or be killed after all. And you don't think the police will arrest you for self-defence.<br><br> You quietly walk up to the disoriented man on the ground and stab him. The man dies. You slide the knife out of his body, keeping it in case you'll need it. You see the book the man was carrying earlier sticking out of his coat pocket. Feeling like it's important, you take it with you. You feel guilty about his death, but there was nothing else you could have done.<br><br> You leave the body behind and walk tiredly down the stairs.<br><br> When you reach the school gates, you see a girl holding a book similar to the one the man had. Instantly on alert, you pull out the bloody knife and hold it up defensively. The girl laughs and tells you she's not here to hurt you.<br><br> You can listen to what she has to say or not.<br><br>
