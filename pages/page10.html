            <p>There's nothing great about this group, no reason to stick back with them. You leave the two future books you have next to the moniters, believing they'll be in better use with the group than with you. Leaving immediately, you head back to your house. You're a bit paranoid however, and when you get back home, you ask your parents if you can move back to the city where your grandparents live, a couple hours away from your current location. Your parents don't want to go, but they're okay with you living with your grandparents.<br><br> In a month, you're on a flight to the new city you'll be living in. When you step out of the airport, waving to your grandparents, you feel glad that you left the trouble-bringing future diaries to that group. Now you can live out your life normally.<br><br> Life's going to be good for you.<br><br></p>
