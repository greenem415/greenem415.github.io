    7:00 AM. Your alarm beeps persistently until you reluctantly reach your hand over to silence it. You would've normally fallen back to sleep, but today is not a normal day. You are surprised to see a large book placed on your bedside table. Out of curiosity, you pick it up and look at the cover. "2017," it reads. Before you can open it, your mother walks in furiously. You're five minutes late for school.<br><br>
3:00 PM. The bell rings. You're relieved that yet another monotonous day of school has come to an end. You spring out of your seat and begin a hasty walk home in order to further examine the book. You rush past a man holding a book in his hand.<br><br>
You hear the soft scuttling of feet behind you. You look back. It's the man, and he's sprinting towards you. He is surprisingly fast for a man of his age and condition. You run.<br><br>
You turn and face him at the end of a dark alleyway. He draws a knife. You cower in fear. Grinning, the man lowers his knife and begins to speak. Noticing he is off-guard, you quickly sprint past him and plot a course back to the school.<br><br>
You reach the familiar grounds of the school, but they are deserted. You hope to lose him by climbing up to the roof. He climbs up after you, and corners you. You know it's a matter of life or death, and manage to wrestle the knife out of his hand. Now he is the one cowering in fear. You can kill him or let him go.<br><br>
