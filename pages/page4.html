            <p>The girl doesn't seem like she wants to hurt you, and either way, you have a knife to protect yourself with. You decide to listen to what she has to say. The girl introduces herself with her codename, 'A'. She explains about the strange books and the man who came to kill you.<br><br> She says around the world, twenty people have each gotten one of those books, and you are one of them. The books list out important events all across the world- events that take place years in the future. Each book has part of the future written in it, but only one year per book. There are twenty years of the future written out. People with these books, like the man who tried to kill you, want all the books for themselves so that they can control the future.<br><br> 'A' says she is part of a five-person group that tracked and killed the remaining greedy fourteen people with books. Now, they want you to join their group.<br><br> The offer sounds like a good idea, but you don't know if this girl is trustworthy enough to follow her. You have the option to join the group.<br><br>
