            <p>You decide to go with her. It would be a good choice to join the group, and they seemed to be good people from the girl's description. She seems happy that you agreed, and guides you from the school to an unknown location about a twenty minute's walk away. 'A' opens a door to a garage and ushers you in. You immediately see five people talking over a couple computer screens and monitors. They're in a heated discussion and don't even notice when you and 'A' sit down behind them. Listening closely, you realize that they're arguing about what to do now that all other fourteen future book holders are dead. The screen shows a page that contains only two buttons: 'Tell the world' and 'Keep it secret'. They're debating over whether to tell the world about the future books, or keep it a secret. You zone out of the discussion, wondering what you'd do. The five others get up and go somewhere, leaving you alone with the computer screens. You stare at the monitors. You can make the choice right now.<br><br></p>
