            <p>You believe the world has a right to know about the future! You click the first button. <br><br>
*1 week later* The world has blown up in controversy over the thought of books that hold the future. The four group members and 'A' have long since ditched the garage, blaming you for the world's outburst. The government, eager to find the books, has found out you have two of them. You are constantly on the run, since you now know that you can not let anyone have knowledge of the future. You do not look inside the books either, scared of what you'll find. <br><br>
*1 month later* Running and hiding continuously has worn you down, but you have to keep the future secure, so you keep going.<br><br>
*1 year later* There's no way you can keep this up. Being on the run from the world not easy, and it doesn't look like people will stop chasing you anytime soon. But you're tired of running, and you don't care about the books anymore. You rip up the future books into pieces and set the shreds on fire. They're finally gone. No more responsibility, no more hiding. You sit down in relief and don't get up when the police cars catch up to you. You smile up at them, and are about to tell them that they don't have to worry about the books anymore, but your words stop when a bullet pierces your body. Multiple guns are shot at you, and you die before saying anything. The search for the other books continues.<br><br><img id="you_died" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="http://86bb71d19d3bcb79effc-d9e6924a0395cb1b5b9f03b7640d26eb.r91.cf1.rackcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/resident-evil-6-you-are-dead-screen.jpg"></p>
