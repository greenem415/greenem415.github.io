          <p>In a show of good faith, you decide to let the creepy guy go. You've never killed anyone anyways, and don't feel like saying that you have. You hold the knife, still a bit wary, but tell him to go away and leave you alone. He nods. You relax now that he's agreed to go peacefully.<br><br> Your carelessness is unrewarded.<br><br> The man leaps forward and grabs you by the throat. You drop the knife on the ground and struggle to breathe. The man keeps one hand around your neck and reaches down for the knife. He stabs you in the neck, instantly killing you.<br><br><img id="you_died" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="http://86bb71d19d3bcb79effc-d9e6924a0395cb1b5b9f03b7640d26eb.r91.cf1.rackcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/resident-evil-6-you-are-dead-screen.jpg"></p>
